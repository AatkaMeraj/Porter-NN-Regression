# Porter: Delivery_Time_Estimation-NN-Regression

🚀 Project Overview

Porter, India's largest intra-city logistics marketplace, connects restaurants with delivery partners to ensure fast and efficient food delivery. To enhance customer experience, this project aims to predict the estimated delivery time based on key factors such as:

✅ Order details (food type, quantity, preparation time)
✅ Restaurant location
✅ Delivery partner availability & efficiency

🎯 Objective

Train a regression model to predict accurate delivery times.
Identify key factors affecting delivery efficiency.
Provide reliable estimates to improve customer satisfaction.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Neural Network
Feature Engineering: Delivery time calculation , Hour & weekday calculation
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score

📂 Dataset

Features:
🔹 Restaurant details (total_items, items_price, store_category)
🔹 Order details total_orders)
🔹 Delivery partner information (total_partner, available_partner)

🔍 Approach

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key trends in delivery times.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Extract useful features
4️⃣ Model Selection & Training: Train regression and NN models and compare performance.
5️⃣ Evaluation & Optimization: Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.

📈 Expected Outcomes

🔹 Accurate delivery time predictions.
🔹 Insights into factors affecting delays.
🔹 Improved customer satisfaction through better estimates.
